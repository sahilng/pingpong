.SH NAME
pingpong \- A tool to check request time and retrieve the response of a given URL.

.SH DESCRIPTION
pingpong is a simple utility that measures the request time of a given URL and displays its response. If no protocol (http or https) is specified in the URL, the tool assumes http by default. In case of redirection (e.g., from http to https), it will notify the user for more accurate timing.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Hide the HTML response and display only the request time.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Check request time and display HTML response:
.B pingpong
https://example.com
.TP
Check request time without displaying HTML response:
.B pingpong
\-h https://example.com
.TP

.B pingpong
example.com
.SH NOTES
If a redirect is detected (e.g., from http to https), pingpong will inform the user and suggest testing directly with https for more accurate timing.
